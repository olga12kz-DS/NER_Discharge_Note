# NER_Discharge_Note
This is the code (Google Colab friendly) to supplement the slides. Please note that due to the rules on using the MIMIC-III data set, the data are not provided. However, the code can be applied to any discharge text. 

Please refer to the Requirements.txt file to review the required libraries and models. 

I recommend reviewing the accompanying slides for the project description and results.
