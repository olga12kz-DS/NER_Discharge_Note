Urine osms were high and Na \\nwas inappropriately elevated (>40), consistent with SIADH as an \\nunderlying etiology.  Upon discussion with the patient's PCP and \\nwith review of outside records (___), it appears that \\nthe patient is chronically hyponatremic and has ranged from \\n119-138 in the past ___ years, with her last known measurement as \\n134 on ___.

If the patient's hyponatremia \\npersists/worsens with symptoms, the patient could potentially \\nbenefit from sodium tablet supplementation.  At this time, we \\nhave only encouraged the patient to eat a high salt diet.

For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by\\n0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He\\nsuccessfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but\\nbegan to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his\\nneurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. \\nDespite\\nthe changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted\\nprogressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.\\nThis has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the\\nbathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on\\n___ was reassuring. \\n\\nOn the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to\\nexperience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his\\nbackyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the\\ncouch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.\\nThe fall was witnessed and there was no head strike.

On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper\\nextremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a\\nnegative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no \\nEKG\\nchanges), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. \\nChest\\nXray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was\\nevaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for\\nfailure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,\\nand complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his\\nhome pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  \\n\\nOn arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed.

He is not sure why he is here\\nand begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor\\ncross race in his backyard.

Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs  , normotensive, and SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease   strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no EKG changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications, and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is in the hospital and that it is  . He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he mentions that he has not had a fall for   years. He denies any fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.
